          Congratulations on landing this internship! We are all \
          very excited!  However, the Great Festival Of The Bountiful \
          Mother Nature is close, so we are all very busy right now. Too \
          busy, in fact, to follow up on these reports of unusual \
          events. \
          If YOU could look into these and make sense of them, that would be a \
          real help. Here is a broom, so you can get there a little faster. \
          Good luck! "] -> subgraph {
